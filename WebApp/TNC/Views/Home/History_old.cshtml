                True North Composites is the exclusive manufacturer of the proprietary material
                and designs are protected under a licensing agreement with the founder Rudolph Oelofse.
                Our mission: <span id="highlight">Improving Life Through <span class="highlight">Responsible</span>
                    Technologies</span></p>
            <p>
                Originally from Cape Town, South Africa Oelofse received his education while in
                the South African Navy at Wingfield Navy College. An avid traveler and expert yachtsman,
                Oelofse sailed around the world for six years captaining vessels from South Africa
                to Alaska.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1989</b>- Oelofse settled in and opened a successful shipyard in Seattle, Washington
                specializing in ship/yacht repair construction and remodeling projects including
                ferries, cruise ships, and commercial fishing vessels up to 400' in length. While
                operating the shipyard, Oelofse concurrently developed prototype vessels for military
                applications and specialized competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                His respected forte: Innovation and experience in designs as well as systems and
                material applications. Innovation and experience is also the foundation for Oelofse’s
                / True North Composites superior composite products and processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing and responding to the need for product innovation Oelofse has developed
                a composite material ten (10) times stronger than steel at six (6) % the weight,
                versatile, and element resistant. Not only is this superior product ideal for marine
                environments but has unlimited applications potential and can be manufactured with
                replicable and scalable production processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2005-2006</b> Oelofse designed and built the world’s first ‘all composite foil assisted
                fast ferry’ using his advanced technology described by industry experts as ‘beyond
                cutting edge’. The vessel exceeds ABS (American Bureau of Shipping), Lloyds of London,
                and DNV (Det Norske Veritas) standards; qualifying it also as the world’s first
                ‘all composite classed high speed ferry’.The vessel has been operating since 2006
                proving the durablity of the material and performance success of the vessel design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another proof of concept project built with this material was erected on
                a remote island 85 miles off the coast of Panama. This structure was specifically
                designed to test logistics and all the systems for generating energy, making water,
                storage, and communications. Additionally 100% self- sustaining, maintenance free,
                and element tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2007</b> - Oelofse developed a unique lift based foil blade design for cylindrical axis
                wind generators. The blade design, developed on hydrodynamic principles, has been
                successfully in operation proving the efficiency of the blade designs since 2008.

                <b>2008-2011</b> - Oelofse fully develops magnetic technology for advanced turbine designs
                schduled to launch first quarter 2013.
