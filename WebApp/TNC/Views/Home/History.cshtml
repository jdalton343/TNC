   <h3> Brief History and Timeline</h3>

<div id="paragraphs"><p>True North Composites is the exclusive manufacturer of the proprietary material and designs are protected under a licensing agreement with the founder Rudolph Oelofse. 
                                         Our mission: <span id="highlight">Improving Life Through <span class="highlight">Responsible</span> Technologies</span></p>

<p>Originally from Cape Town, South Africa Oelofse received his education while in the South African Navy at Wingfield Navy College. An avid traveler and expert yachtsman, Oelofse sailed around the world for six years captaining vessels from South Africa to Alaska. 
 </p>
<p>In 1989 Oelofse settled in and opened a successful shipyard in Seattle, Washington specializing in ship/yacht repair construction and remodeling projects including ferries, cruise ships, and commercial fishing vessels up to 400' in length. While operating the shipyard, Oelofse concurrently developed prototype vessels for military applications and specialized competition.  
</p>
<p>His respected forte: Innovation and experience in designs as well as systems and material applications. Innovation and experience is also the foundation for Oelofse’s / True North Composites superior composite products and processes. 
 </p>
<p >Recognizing and responding to the need for product innovation Oelofse has developed a composite material ten (10) times stronger than steel at six (6) % the weight, versatile, and element resistant. Not only is this superior product ideal for marine environments but has unlimited applications potential and can be manufactured with replicable and scalable production processes. 
</p>
<p>2005-2006 Oelofse designed and built the world’s first ‘all composite foil assisted fast ferry’ using his advanced technology described by industry experts as ‘beyond cutting edge’. The vessel exceeds ABS (American Bureau of Shipping), Lloyds of London, and DNV (Det Norske Veritas) standards; qualifying it also as the world’s first ‘all composite classed high speed ferry’.The vessel has been operating since 2006 proving the durablity of the material and performance success of the vessel design.  
 </p>
<p>2006 - Another proof of concept project built with this material was erected on a remote island 85 miles off the coast of Panama. This structure was specifically designed to test logistics and all the systems for generating energy, making water, storage, and communications. Additionally 100% self- sustaining, maintenance free, and element tested.
</p><p>2007 - Oelofse developed a unique lift based foil blade design for cylindrical axis wind generators. The blade design, developed on hydrodynamic principles, has been successfully in operation proving the efficiency of the blade designs  since 2008. 
 </p>
<p>2008-2011 - Oelofse fully develops magnetic technology for advanced turbine designs schduled to launch first quarter 2013.
</p>
<p>2011 - True North Composites Inc., Opens doors at McClellan Business Park, McClellan CA.
<p>2012 - True North developed our ‘Power in a Box” concept, composite container line, and ReVair turbines with new generation magnetic motors.</p>
